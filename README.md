# Predicting-Bridge-Performance-under-Earthquake-With-Supervised-Learning
In this project, we are trying to train a prediction model for bridge performance under earthquakes with supervised learning. We include several predictors such as materials, bridge age, structural type, earthquake magnitude and the distance between the bridge and the epicenter.
